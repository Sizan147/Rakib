    <h1>Mars</h1>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, and the seventh largest. It’s the only planet we know of inhabited entirely by robots.</p>

    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and has a distinct rusty red appearance and two unusual moons.</p>

    <p>The Red Planet is a cold, desert world within our solar system. It has a very thin atmosphere, but the dusty, lifeless 
        (as far as we know it) planet is far from dull.</p>
       <p> Phenomenal dust storms can grow so large they engulf the entire planet, temperatures can get so cold that carbon dioxide
         in the atmosphere condenses directly into snow or frost, and marsquakes — a Mars version of an earthquake — regularly shake 
         things up. Therefore, it is no surprise that this little red rock continues to intrigue scientists and is one of the most explored 
         bodies in the solar system, according to NASA Science.</p>

        <p>Befitting the Red Planet's bloody color, the Romans named it after their god of war. In truth, the Romans copied the ancient Greeks,
         who also named the planet after their god of war, Ares.</p> 
        <p>Other civilizations also typically gave the planet names based on its color — for example, the Egyptians named it "Her Desher," meaning
             "the red one," while ancient Chinese astronomers dubbed it "the fire star."</p>
