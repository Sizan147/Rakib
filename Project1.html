     <p>We explore how long it takes to get to Mars and the factors that affect a journey to the Red Planet.</p>

     <p>Ever wondered how long does it take to get to Mars? </p> 
     <p>The answer depends on several factors, ranging from the position of Earth and Mars to the technology that would propel you
       there. According to NASA, a one-way trip to  the Red Planet would take about<strong> nine months</strong> . If you wanted to make
        it a round-trip, all in all, it would take about <strong>21 months </strong>as you will need to wait about three months
        on Mars to make sure Earth and Mars are in  a suitable location to make the trip back home. </p> 
     <p>We take a look at how long a trip to the Red Planet would take using available technology and explore some of the factors that would
       affect your travel time.</p>      

    <h2>HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO TRAVEL TO MARS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT?</h2><hr>

        <small>The average distance between Earth and Mars the two planets is 140 million miles (225 million km). The distance between 
           the two planets affects how long it would take to travel between the two.  (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)</small>
    <p>Light travels at approximately <strong>186,282 miles per second</strong>  (299,792 km per second). Therefore, a light shining
       from the surface of Mars would take the following amount of time to reach Earth (or vice versa):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Closest possible approach: 182 seconds, or 3.03 minutes</li>
        <li>Closest recorded approach: 187 seconds, or 3.11 minutes</li>
        <li> Farthest approach: 1,342 seconds, or 22.4 minutes</li>
        <li>On average: 751 seconds, or just over 12.5 minutes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The time it takes to get from one celestial body to another depends largely on the energy that one is willing to expend.
        Here  "energy" refers to the effort put in by the launch vehicle and the sum of the maneuvers of the rocket motors aboard
        the spacecraft, and the amount of propellant that is used. In space travel, everything boils down to energy. Spaceflight is
        the clever management of </p>

       <p> Some common solutions for transfers to the moon are 1) the Hohmann-like transfer and 2) the Free Return Transfer. The Hohmann
         Transfer is often referred to as the one that requires the lowest energy, but that is true only if you want the transfer to last 
         only a few days and, in addition, if some constraints on the launch apply. Things get very complicated from there on, so I won't
          go into details</p>
        
        <p>Concerning transfers to Mars, these are by necessity interplanetary transfers, i.e., orbits that have the sun as central body.
           Otherwise, much of what was said above applies: the issue remains the expense of energy. An additional complication lies in the
           fact that the Mars orbit is quite eccentric and also its orbit plane is inclined with respect to that of the Earth. And of course,
           Mars requires longer to orbit the sun than the Earth does. All of this is taken into account in a common type of diagram called the
          "pork chop plot", which essentially tells you the required dates of departure and arrival and the amount of energy </p>
       <p>The "pork chop plot" shows the trajectory expert that opportunities for Mars transfers arise around every 25-26 months,
           and that these transfers are subdivided into different classes, one that is a bit faster, with typically around 5-8 months
          and the other that takes about 7-11 months. There are also transfers that take a lot longer, but Iâ€™m not talking about those
          here. Mostly, but not always, the second, slower one turns out to be more efficient energy-wise. A rule of thumb is that the
          transfer to Mars takes around as long as the human period of gestation, approximately 9 months. But that really is no more than
          an approximate value; you still have to do all the math to find out what applies to a specific date. </p>
